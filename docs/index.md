Welcome to Hyperledger Fabric
=============================

Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions,
underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of
confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability. It is designed
to support pluggable implementations of different components, and
accommodate the complexity and intricacies that exist across the
economic ecosystem.

Hyperledger Fabric delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible
architecture, distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions.
Planning for the future of enterprise blockchain requires building on
top of a fully-vetted, open source architecture; Hyperledger Fabric is
your starting point.

It's recommended for first-time users to begin by going through the
[Getting Started][1] section in order to gain familiarity with
the Hyperledger Fabric components and the basic transaction flow. Once
comfortable, continue exploring the library for demos, technical
specifications, APIs, etc.
